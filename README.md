# Face Recognition Model - Machine Learning Project
This project is a machine learning-based face recognition system developed using a Jupyter Notebook. The model is trained to detect and recognize faces in images or real-time video feeds. The primary objective is to create a robust and efficient face recognition system leveraging modern machine learning libraries.

### Key Highlights
Developed a fully functional face recognition system that detects and recognizes faces with high accuracy.
Hands-on experience with Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and face_recognition.
Experienced in real-time face recognition using webcam feeds for live testing.

### Technologies and Skills Demonstrated
Programming Languages: Python
Machine Learning Frameworks: face_recognition
Computer Vision: OpenCV
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Project Management: Jupyter Notebook environment

### Future Improvements
Implement a user-friendly GUI for easier interaction with the system.
Optimize the model for deployment on edge devices.
